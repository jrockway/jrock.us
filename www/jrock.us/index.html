		<p>On some level, the era of personal websites is over.  You might
		enjoy my <a href="https://github.com/jrockway/">Github</a> or my
		<a href="https://plus.google.com/+JonathanRockway">Google+</a> page.
		Both are updated from time to time.  Maybe.</p>

		<p>My amateur radio callsign is <samp>KD2DTW</samp>.</p>
